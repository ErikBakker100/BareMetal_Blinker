For the 32bit version of Blinker running on a Raspberry Pi 2w, the following files need to placed in the root of the SD Card:

bcm2710-rpi-zero-2.dtb
bootcode.bin
config.txt (JTAG is enabled, Bluetooth disabled)
kernel.img (this is the Blinker program itself)
start.elf

The ACT_LED on the Raspberry will blink after running the program.
All mentioned files can be found on the SD_card subdirectory. They can be different in each project directory, so only use the ones in the SD_card directory of this project.
